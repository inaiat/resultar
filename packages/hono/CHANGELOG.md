# resultar-hono

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 2fc19dd: Preserve selected bindings in the `createHonoApp` return type and export
  `InferRequestServices` for application instances and factory functions. Separate route
  files can derive their Hono environment from `typeof createApplication` without repeating
  service tokens. The existing `HonoApplication<CloseError>` contract remains supported;
  inference adds no runtime metadata or lifecycle changes.
  
  Align the guides with the runnable examples: `main.ts` exports `AppHono`, route files
  import that type, and the factory's bindings define the exposed services. Document the
  matching Fastify declaration and self-contained services/routes/main layout.
- 2fc19dd: Allow omitting `bindings` in `createFastifyApp`, `createFastifyPlugin` and `createHonoApp`.
  Omission selects all registered services, validates their requirements and infers their
  readonly request view. Explicit selections and `bindings: []` retain their existing behavior;
  Fastify `appBindings` still defaults to an empty selection. Request locals satisfy dependencies
  but are not automatically exposed as registered services.
  Explicit selections must be literal tuples; ambiguous tuple unions and widened arrays are
  rejected so request types cannot promise services absent from the runtime selection.
  
  Selected services are resolved before the handler, preserving lazy application construction,
  scope lifetimes, failure propagation and cleanup. This is not property-based lazy resolution:
  a failure acquiring any default-selected service prevents the handler from executing.
  
  Use the Fastify and Hono example applications as integration cases in each package's test suite,
  covering their real service graph, native routes, overrides and application isolation without
  starting a listener. Both examples demonstrate omitted bindings and inferred application types.
- 2fc19dd: Reexport the Resultar DI application helpers from both framework integrations: `createModule`, `Service`, `service`, `resource`, and their public types. Applications can declare and register services without importing or directly installing `resultar-di`. Framework-independent shared code can continue using `resultar-di` directly.

### Patch Changes

- 2fc19dd: BREAKING: remove the `resultar-di/advanced` entry point. Replace all imports from
  `resultar-di/advanced` with `resultar-di` before upgrading. The pre-1.0 DI package
  ships this breaking change in its next minor release.
  
  Expose one `createModule` and `ServiceModule` supporting token/class registration,
  named factories, task/resource registration, and fluent composition. Export
  `inspectModule`, `withProvider`, `useServiceAccess`, `ServiceAccessError` and their
  public types from the same entry point. Resolution, lazy initialization, lifetimes
  and resource ownership remain unchanged. No compatibility alias is retained.
  
  Update Fastify and Hono to use the unified entry point while preserving their
  explicit application-facing DI reexports. External framework facades that
  imported the removed subpath must migrate their imports when adopting this release.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 1ffab20: Add a native Fastify plugin with typed application and request service selections, request locals,
  startup rollback, cancellation and resource cleanup through streamed responses. Add per-route
  Hono services middleware that preserves native bindings and RPC inference. Both integrations
  reuse Resultar DI scopes; application callbacks can explicitly restrict resolution to singletons
  with useSingletons. Existing createHonoApp behavior remains compatible.
  Compose Fastify lifecycle recovery with Resultar while preserving original failures and awaited rollback.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- fcf0f14: Add typed Hono bindings, response-scoped service ownership and explicit application shutdown. Provide a runnable Deno example without runtime-specific adapters. Export adapter type helpers from DI's advanced entry point and generate declaration imports that resolve in Deno workspace consumers.
